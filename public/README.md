# Logo Setup

Please save your "Go Automate" logo image as `logo.png` in this public directory.

The logo should be:
- Format: PNG (recommended) or JPG
- Dimensions: Approximately 200x40 pixels (or similar aspect ratio)
- Background: Transparent (for PNG) or matching the header background

The Header component is already configured to use `/logo.png`.
